# Lane-Line-Detection-Robot
TurtleBot3 lane and obstacle detection using YOLOv8s-seg and custom dataset.

This project focuses on **lane and obstacle detection for autonomous navigation** using a **custom dataset** and the **YOLOv8s-seg** model.  
The system helps TurtleBot3 detect lanes, vehicles, and obstacles in real time for improved navigation accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time **lane and obstacle segmentation** using YOLOv8s-seg  
- **Custom dataset** created and annotated for lane and object classes  
- Works with **TurtleBot3** in simulation or real environment  
- Outputs bounding boxes and masks on live camera feed  
- Achieved **over 90% detection accuracy** on custom data
